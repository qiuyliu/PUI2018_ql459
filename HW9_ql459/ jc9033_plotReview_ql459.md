 Here is my(ql459) review for Junjie Cai, jc9033

CLARITY: The figure is easy to read. Junjie created the scatter plot and also drawed the line to fit the model, which is clear to see. It shows the FDNY's number of incidents in average response time in the last 8 years. The plot has correct labels, legendï¼Œcaption and clear scatter and line for visualization. However, it is better to add the unit (second) for the average response time. For the title, it is better to add 'monthly' before 'the number of incidents' since the x is monthly number of incidents, which could be clearer for others.


ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The figure is clearly explaining the positivly linear relationship between the average response time and the number of incidents. The scatter plot is in blue and the linear regression line is in red, which are easy to understand the relationship inside. However, I would suggest to put the time as x-axis. Since time is the independent variable, and the depenedent variable, number of incidents, should be on y-axis. I went through the data wrangling part which are good on choosing the number of incidents and corresponding time.



HONESTY: The plot is honestly reproducing the data. The data used for creating the linear regression line and scatter plot are done properly.

IMPROVMENT: One improvement is replacing the x-axis as the time and y-axis as the number of incidents. Another improvement you can do is to add the caption of conclusion for your plot.
