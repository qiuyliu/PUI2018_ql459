My (Nathan Caplan, nbc270) plot review for ql459:

Clarity: The figure produced is very clear. It tells a story about green taxi trip duration data starting at 10 AM for one day, using a poisson distribution Â to do so. It provides the frequency of the trip duration as well as the seconds per each trip duration. All labels appear correct.

Esthetic: The figure is esthetically pleasing. The distribution is less opaque than the poisson curve, so even though they are both red, you can see both the distribution and curve clearly. You can also see all labels, the title, the description, and the plot itself without having to scroll. 

Honesty: The plot is reproducing the data. I followed the script to produce the plot and found that is was done properly to create the distribution. 

Improvements: Perhaps adding a label with a mean and standard deviation, just so the viewer can find more facts about the distribution and can allow more of story to be told about the data being viewed.
