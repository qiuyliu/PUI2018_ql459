#### Plot: The trip duration distribution of NYC green taxi on 10am in Nov. 15th, 2017

### CLARITY: 

1. The plot is easy to read.

2. The axes have proper lables, however the Y axis does not mention units, I would suggest adding them. 
Also, "seconds" as units for taxi ride does not seem appropriate to me. I would change to minutes.

3. It is not clear what the pink line is referring to, it should be added to the legend with the relevant description

4. There is no caption in the plot and therefore it is not very clear what was the message the author wanted to convey.


### ESTHETIC: 

1. The plot looks nice visualy. A good balance of graphical content and relevant information. 

2. The color choice could be improved, the line is of the same color as the main graph. 
It is not easy to distinguish between the two pieces of information that the author wanted to convey.


### HONESTY: 

1. It seems the plot is honest and reproducing the data correctly.

2. However as per my comment above, it is not clear what the pink line is referring to, so I cannot be totally sure that the plot is correctly reproducing the data.


 ### SUGGESTION: 
 
1. Improve the axis (add frequency units and amend the time units)

2. Change the color of the pink line and add a description of it in the legend

3. Add well-informed caption for the plot to emphasize a point that author wanted to say (i.e. the highest frequency of usage is observed ... ).

4. Title can also be changed to have no shortcuts like "Nov. 15th, 2017"
