## I'm reviewing Yaxuan Yi's citi-bike multi week homework

### 1. Verify your Null and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly:
<<<<<<< HEAD
#### I didn't see the null and alternative hypotheses you mentioned in the notebook. I read your code and command, it same like 
null hypothesis is "the average travel time of new bus route is slower than/as the same as the old route travel time"
alternative hypothesis is "the average travel time of new bus route is faster than the old route travel time"

### 2. Verify that the data supports the project:

### 3. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked:
=======
#### I didn't see the null and alternative hypotheses you mentioned in the notebook. There are two histograms one presents the number of rides against the age, and the other one is presenting the gender against the number of rides.
I read your code and command and I recommend to establish the hypothesis and formulas in this way below.
- null hypothesis is "the average travel time of bus route after 1990 is slower or the same as the route before 1990"
- alternative hypothesis is "the average travel time of new bus route is faster than the old route travel time"
#### And there is formulated hypothesis:
##### t0 = travel time of old bus
##### t1 = travel time of new bus
##### H_0 : t0 <= t1
##### H_1 : t0 > t1

### 2. Verify that the data supports the project:
#### the reducted data and histogram are good. If your hypothesis is what I mention above, presenting the data in scatter plot would also be a good choice for visualization.

### 3. Choose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked:
#### You choose z-test here to test.
